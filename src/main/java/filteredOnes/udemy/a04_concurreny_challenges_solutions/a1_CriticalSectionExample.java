And as we can see, we get completely, we lead different results every single time.
So obviously our computer is not broken.
It's our intuition that we build from single threaded application programming that needs to be adjusted.
The core of the problem is two folded.
First of all, the inventory counter is a shared object with passing to both threads, which makes the items, member variable,
also sharing it and accessible in both threads second and most critical one is the operation that both threads are performing by calling the increment and decrement methods.

These methods are executed at the same time and they are not atomic operations.
